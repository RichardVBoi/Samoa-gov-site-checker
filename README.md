## 🙏 Credits & Inspiration

This project was inspired by the original **[Samoa Government Sites Checker](https://github.com/westerandr/govt-site-checker)** created by **[Andre Westerlund](https://github.com/westerandr)**.

Andre's original project at [samoagov.online](https://www.samoagov.online) was the foundation that inspired me to expand this initiative and support our Samoan community with comprehensive government service monitoring.

**Fa'afetai tele lava, uso Andre!** 🙏

- 🏛️ Citizens quickly verify if government services are available
- 📊 Track historical uptime of government websites
- 🔔 Provide transparency on government digital infrastructure
- 🌐 Support Samoa's digital transformation journey
